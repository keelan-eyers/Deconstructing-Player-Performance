Deconstructing Player Performance: A PCA and Random Forest based approach

Player performance evaluation in professional football is essential for informed decision- making by coaches, scouts, and analysts. Traditional methods often rely on subjective assessments, leading to inconsistent and biased evaluations. This study aims to provide a more objective evaluation by utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Random Forest regression. The PCA approach reduces dimensionality and creates composite performance scores from a comprehensive set of metrics, offering a holistic view of player performance. Random Forest regression identifies key performance metrics influencing player market value, providing insights into which attributes are most valued in the market.The dataset, sourced from FB REF and Transfermarkt, includes performance metrics for 569 players from the 2022/2023 Premier League season. Results show that different metrics drive performance and market value for defenders, midfielders, and forward. The analysis highlights the complexity of market valuation and identifies over- and undervalued players. This study contributes to football analytics by presenting a robust methodology for objective player evaluation and market value prediction, offering valuable insights for talent acquisition and player development. Future research should incorporate broader datasets and additional factors to enhance model performance and predictive power
